# All configs from this plugin has an auto updater. Meaning if I add a value in the config from updates,
# the value will be automatically added without regenerating the configs.
#
# Player Death Messages Config
#
#Placeholders:
# %player% - returns the player name
# %player_display% - returns the custom display name of the player
# %weapon% - returns a tooltip of the item name, lore, and enchantments
# %killer% - returns the entity's name. If there is no name set, it will be the entity type.
# %killer_display% - if the killer is a player, returns the display name of the player
# %killer_type% - returns the entity type from Mobs.<Mob> in Messages.yml
# %biome% - returns the biome name the player located
# %world% - returns the world name
# %world_environment% - returns the environment of the world (normal, nether, the_end) (These are configurable in Messages.yml (Environment))
# %x% - returns the x position the player died at.
# %y% - returns the y position the player died at.
# %z% - returns the z position the player died at.
# %distance% represents the distance between the player and the killer in blocks (if applicable)
#
#Text components:
#
# Using "::" in the messages will create text components.
# Format as followed: Base text::Hover text::Action
# Actions must start with either COMMAND:, or SUGGEST_COMMAND:
# You can add lines in the hover messages like so "line one\nLine Two....."
# Examples:
# "%player% was killed by [%killer%::&cLocations: X:%x%, Y:%y%, Z:%z%::COMMAND::tppos %x% %y% %z%]"
# "%player% was killed by [%killer%::&cLocations: X:%x%, Y:%y%, Z:%z%]"
# "%player% was killed by [%killer%::&cLocations: X:%x%, Y:%y%, Z:%z%::SUGGEST_COMMAND::msg %player% lol noob]"
#
# Permissions Based Messages
#
# For victims that have a specific permission set, EX: deathmessages.premium, the death message
# will be sent that is formatted as followed:
# PERMISSION[YOUR.PERM.HERE]%player% dead lol
#
# For killers that have a specific permission set, EX: deathmessages.premium, the death message
# will be sent that is formatted as followed:
# PERMISSION_KILLER[YOUR.PERM.HERE]%killer% REKT %player%
#
# Players that are in a region (With WorldGuard hook enabled) and is defined below, will be sending a custom
# region messages.
# Formatted as followed: "REGION[REGION_NAME]%player% died in a region"
# Example:
#
# Mobs:
#   player:
#     Melee:
#       - "%player% was slain by %killer%"
#       - "PERMISSION[deathmessages.premium]&6Premium %player% &fdied to %killer%
#       - "REGION[spawn]Idiot %player% died in spawn lol"
#       If the player has permission and in a region
#       - "REGION[spawn]PERMISSION[deathmessages.premium]Idiot premium %player% died in spawn lol"
#
# To completely remove the message for a certain death. Configure as followed:
# Natrual-Death:
#   Bed: []
# or
# Mobs:
#   Creeper:
#     Solo:
#       Explosion: []

# Due for there being no cure for laziness, this option ignores everything in the Mobs section and makes all messages
# appear the same.
